## Phase 1: Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish core Streamlit application with project structure, DTC data loading, and basic 4-step wizard UI

**Requirements:** DTC-01, DTC-07, UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, INF-01, INF-02, INF-05

### Success Criteria

1. User can launch Streamlit app and see 4-step wizard interface
2. DTC prompts loaded from repository or local cache
3. ai_agent_cpt.yaml parsed and accessible
4. User can enter industry, use case, jurisdiction inputs
5. Session state persists across page interactions
6. Configuration file supports API key and model settings

### Deliverables

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `config.yaml` - Model and API configuration
- `prompts/` - DTC prompt templates (fetched from repo)
- `data/ai_agent_cpt.yaml` - Capability definitions
- `modules/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `components/sidebar.py` - Navigation component
- `components/progress.py` - Step progress indicator

## Phase 2: Research Integration

**Goal:** Integrate Open Deep Research with DTC-specific research brief for grounded industry analysis

**Requirements:** RES-01, RES-02, RES-03, RES-05, DTC-02

### Success Criteria

1. User inputs trigger comprehensive research across 5 areas
2. Research returns cited sources with URLs
3. Research produces preliminary T0-T4 recommendation
4. Research results stored in session state for downstream steps
5. Research can be re-run with modified inputs

### Deliverables

- `modules/research.py` - Open Deep Research integration
- Enhanced Step 0 research brief template
- Research result data structures
- Integration with Anthropic Claude API

## Phase 3: DTC Workflow

**Goal:** Execute complete DTC 4-step workflow with proper output chaining and human-in-the-loop checkpoints

**Requirements:** DTC-03, DTC-04, DTC-05, DTC-06, RES-04, UI-04, UI-05, UI-06, INF-04

### Success Criteria

1. Step 1 generates business requirements from research + user context
2. Step 2 assesses agent type with user confirmation dialog
3. Step 3 maps to 45 capabilities with justifications
4. Each step receives outputs from all prior steps
5. User can pause and review at each step transition
6. Progress indicators show LLM operation status

### Deliverables

- `modules/requirements.py` - Step 1 execution
- `modules/agent_design.py` - Step 2 execution
- `modules/capability_mapping.py` - Step 3 execution
- `components/research_display.py` - Research results UI
- Step transition confirmation dialogs
- Output chaining logic

## Phase 4: Polish & Export

**Goal:** Interactive CPT visualization, export capabilities, responsive design, error handling

**Requirements:** UI-07, UI-08, EXP-01, EXP-02, EXP-03, EXP-04, EXP-05, INF-03

### Success Criteria

1. Interactive periodic table shows 45 capabilities with color coding
2. Capability cards show priority, justification, maturity level
3. Export produces professional PDF/DOCX documents
4. HTML visualization is self-contained and shareable
5. Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
6. UI works well on various screen sizes

### Deliverables

- `components/periodic_table.py` - Interactive CPT visualization
- `modules/export.py` - Document generation (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Error handling wrappers
- Responsive CSS/styling
- Complete planning package export
